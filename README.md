# mad-from-scratch
This repository is a series of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science algorithms built from scractch as a learning experience.

The following algorithms are implemented in Python:

- Linear regression
- Markov Decission Precoss (MDP)
	- Basics of MDP (grid world)
	- Policy Iteration
	- Value Iteration
